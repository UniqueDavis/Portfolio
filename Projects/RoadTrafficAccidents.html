  <h1>Project Two: Road Traffic Accident Severity Classification</h1>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
  Road traffic accidents are a serious global issue, contributing to high injury and fatality rates worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Every year, the lives of approximately 1.19 million people 
  are cut short as a result of a road traffic crashs." While improvements in road safety measures and vehicle technology have helped reduce risks, understanding the key factors that contribute to accident severity is crucial 
  for prevention and policy-making. By analyzing accident data, we can identify patterns and risk factors that could lead to safer roads and fewer fatalities.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents" target="_blank">
      Road Traffic Accidents Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What factors most significantly influence the severity of traffic accidents, and how can they be used to predict accident outcomes?</li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to explore meaningful patterns in road traffic accidents and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various factors influence accident severity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 12316 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 15 features. These features are important variables in determining the risk and severity of road traffic accidents. The features include:</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>

  <p>
  The dataset I am using is a pre-cleaned version from Kaggle, which I selected after evaluating both the raw and cleaned datasets to ensure the preprocessing was consistent and effective. While inspecting the data 
  using functions like .shape, .columns, and .head(), I noticed that the cleaned version removed columns with missing values (NaN or NA), a time-related column, and other less relevant features. This reduced the 
  original 32 columns to 15, making the dataset more concise for analysis while preserving key information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>

<p>
    I plotted pie charts and histograms to visualize the distribution of drivers' age bands and their driving experience. The plots relate to our modeling because by observing the distribution of experience and ages, it can show us whether certain levels of experience and ages are more prone to accidents, which could help inform accident severity predictions in the Random Forest model.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The pie chart shows the proportion of drivers within different age bands involved in accidents. This provides us with a good understanding of which age groups are most common in the dataset. The chart shows that the age group 18-30 is the most frequent in traffic accidents, which could be a useful feature for building predictive models.
    </li>
    <li>
        The histogram shows us how many years of driving experience are distributed among the drivers in the dataset. This visualization helps us understand the frequency of drivers with varying levels of experience, from less than one year to more than ten years of experience. It also gives an insight into the skewness of the data, as the distribution might indicate whether the dataset has a higher concentration of novice or experienced drivers.

  <h2>Modeling</h2>
   <p>
    I will be using a Random Forest model. Random Forest builds several decision trees and combines their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It handles imbalanced datasets well, is robust against missing data, and isn't heavily affected by outliers. However, 
    it can be computationally intensive and harder to interpret. I chose both of these models because I thought they'd work best for my dataset, which is mostly categorical. Random Forest can best answer my question, 
    "What factors contribute most to severe accidents?" because it gives me feature importance, helping pinpoint which factors matter most when it comes to severity.

  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
   <p>
    To evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model, I used the following metrics:

1. Accuracy Score
Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It is a common evaluation metric for classification problems but may not be reliable in imbalanced datasets (as is the case here, with different levels of severity in accident data).

2. Classification Report
The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (severity levels in the dataset).

Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall measures the ability of the model to find all relevant instances (how well it detects a specific class).
F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
These metrics are particularly useful in cases with imbalanced classes, like accident severity, where certain classes (e.g., severe accidents) might be underrepresented.

3. Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix helps visualize the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This allows us to understand how well the model performs across different severity levels and whether it tends to misclassify certain classes.
  </p>
  <h2>Storytelling</h2>
  <p>
    The modeling process helped answer several important questions about the dataset. For example, we were able to predict Accident Severity with a reasonable degree of accuracy (approximately 83%) based on driver characteristics, road conditions, and accident specifics. This suggests that certain features in the dataset, such as Age_band_of_driver and Driving_experience, provide strong signals for predicting accident severity.

However, the classification report shows a significant discrepancy between the modelâ€™s performance on different classes, with severe accidents (represented by class 2) being predicted with much higher accuracy compared to minor accidents (class 1). This highlights a potential class imbalance in the dataset, where certain severity levels are underrepresented, impacting the model's ability to generalize across all classes.
  </p>
  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
  <p>
    The impact of this project can be observed in several areas:

Social Impact:
By predicting accident severity more accurately, we can contribute to a better understanding of traffic accidents, leading to improved safety measures. If the model is deployed in real-world scenarios (e.g., insurance companies, traffic management systems), it could help predict the severity of accidents in real-time, allowing for quicker responses to severe accidents.

Ethical Considerations:
There is a risk that the model could perpetuate or exacerbate biases, particularly if the dataset underrepresents certain demographic groups (e.g., gender or age). For example, if young drivers are overrepresented in the dataset, the model might incorrectly associate younger drivers with higher accident severity, potentially leading to biased insurance premiums or unfair treatment in safety initiatives.

Negative Impact:
While the model aims to improve safety and risk prediction, it could inadvertently lead to unfair consequences if deployed without proper oversight. For example, the model's predictions might influence policy or decision-making in ways that disproportionately impact certain groups, such as young drivers, by increasing insurance rates or limiting access to safer driving environments.
