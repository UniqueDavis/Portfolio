  <h1>Project Two: Road Traffic Accident Severity Classification</h1>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
  Road traffic accidents are a serious global issue, contributing to high injury and fatality rates worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "Every year, the lives of approximately 1.19 million people 
  are cut short as a result of a road traffic crashs." While improvements in road safety measures and vehicle technology have helped reduce risks, understanding the key factors that contribute to accident severity is crucial 
  for prevention and policy-making. By analyzing accident data, we can identify patterns and risk factors that could lead to safer roads and fewer fatalities.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents" target="_blank">
      Road Traffic Accidents Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What factors contribute most to severe accidents?</li> 
    <li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to explore meaningful patterns in road traffic accidents and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various factors influence accident severity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 12316 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 15 features. These features are important variables in determining the risk and severity of road traffic accidents. The features include:</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>

  <p>
  The dataset I am using is a pre-cleaned version from Kaggle, which I selected after evaluating both the raw and cleaned datasets to ensure the preprocessing was consistent and effective. While inspecting the data 
  using functions like .shape, .columns, and .head(), I noticed that the cleaned version removed columns with missing values (NaN or NA), a time-related column, and other less relevant features. This reduced the 
  original 32 columns to 15, making the dataset more concise for analysis while preserving key information.

  <h2>Modeling</h2>
   <p>
    I will be using a Naive Bayes and Random Forest model. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' theorem to predict the likelihood of a class based on features, assuming they are independent. 
    It's fast, scalable, and works well for large datasets with multiple classes. However, it assumes that features are independent, which can be a limitation in real-world data with dependencies. Random Forest builds 
    several decision trees and combines their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It handles imbalanced datasets well, is robust against missing data, and isn't heavily affected by outliers. However, 
    it can be computationally intensive and harder to interpret. I chose both of these models because I thought they'd work best for my dataset, which is mostly categorical. Random Forest can best answer my question, 
    "What factors contribute most to severe accidents?" because it gives me feature importance, helping pinpoint which factors matter most when it comes to severity. Naive Bayes can best answer, "How does driving experience 
    influence accident severity?" because it's quick, simple, and works well with categorical data, providing a strong starting point for understanding the relationship.
