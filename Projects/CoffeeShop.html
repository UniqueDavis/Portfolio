  <h1>Project Three: Optimizing Coffee Shop Revenue Using Regression </h1>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
  Ro
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himelsarder/coffee-shop-daily-revenue-prediction-dataset/data" target="_blank">
      Coffee Shop Daily Revenue Prediction Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How much revenue will the coffee shop generate on a given day based on customer traffic, marketing spend, and other factors?</li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to uncover meaningful patterns in daily coffee shop revenue and dive into how factors like marketing spend, foot traffic, and staffing impact sales performance through regression analysis.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 2,000 rows, each representing a day of operation for a coffee shop, and 7 features. These features are important variables that influence daily revenue. The features include:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of Customers Per Day</td>
      <td>Total number of customers visiting the coffee shop on any given day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average Order Value ($)</td>
      <td>The average dollar amount spent by each customer during their visit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Operating Hours Per Day</td>
      <td>The total number of hours the coffee shop is open for business each day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of Employees</td>
      <td>The number of employees working on a given day. This can influence service speed, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, sales.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Marketing Spend Per Day ($)</td>
      <td>The amount of money spent on marketing campaigns or promotions on any given day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Location Foot Traffic (people/hour)</td>
      <td>The number of people passing by the coffee shop per hour, a variable indicative of the shop's location and its potential to attract customers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Daily Revenue ($)</td>
      <td>The total revenue generated by the coffee shop each day. It is calculated as a combination of customer visits, average spending, and other operational factors like marketing spend and staff availability.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <h2>What is regression and how does it work?</h2>
  <p>
  Regression in machine learning refers to a supervised learning technique where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on one or more independent features. It finds relationships between variables so that predictions can be made. There are many types of regression such as simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and support vector regression.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiment 1: Data understanding</h2>
<p>
    To begin the analysis, I first explored the dataset for any patterns, correlations, and distributions. I made a pairplot to visualize the relationships between all of the features. From this I noticed that Number_of_Customers_Per_Day and Average_Order_Value had a strong corelation with Daily_Revenue. For Marketing_Spend_Per_Day and Location_Foot_Traffic there was only a faint amount of correlation with Daily_Revenue. Then for Operating_Hours_Per_Day and Number_of_Employees
   theres no corelation with Daily_Revenue

  <h2>Experiment 1: Pre-processing</h2>
<p>
    Before applying the model, I first checked the dataset for missing values and duplicates. This is an important step because any missing data or duplicate records could skew the results of the regression model. I used basic data exploration methods like isnull() to identify missing values and duplicated() to check for any duplicate rows.
  Since the dataset did not contain any missing values or duplicates, I began modeling without needing to clean the data further.
</p>

  <h2>Experiment 1: Modeling</h2>
<p>
    For the first experiment, I built a linear regression model to predict the coffee shop's performance based on the available features. The model was implemented using the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library in Python. I split the dataset into training and testing sets, training the model on the training data, and using it to predict on the testing data.
</p>
  
  <h2>Experiment 1: Evaluation</h2>
<p>
    To evaluate the performance of the linear regression model, I used several key metrics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> 245.85</li>
  <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> 97065.55</li>
  <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> 311.55</li>
  <li><strong>R² Score:</strong> 0.89</li>
</ul>
  <p>
  These results indicate that the model fits the data well. The model's performance shows strong predictive capability with an R² score of 0.89, indicating that 89% of the variance in the coffee shop’s performance is explained by the features, suggesting a good fit.
