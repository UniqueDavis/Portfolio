  <h1>Project Three: Optimizing Coffee Shop Revenue Using Regression </h1>

    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himelsarder/coffee-shop-daily-revenue-prediction-dataset/data" target="_blank">
      Coffee Shop Daily Revenue Prediction Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How much revenue will the coffee shop generate on a given day based on customer traffic, marketing spend, and other factors?</li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to uncover meaningful patterns in daily coffee shop revenue and dive into how factors like marketing spend, foot traffic, and staffing impact sales performance through regression analysis.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 2,000 rows, each representing a day of operation for a coffee shop, and 7 features. These features are important variables that influence daily revenue. The features include:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of Customers Per Day</td>
      <td>Total number of customers visiting the coffee shop on any given day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Average Order Value ($)</td>
      <td>The average dollar amount spent by each customer during their visit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Operating Hours Per Day</td>
      <td>The total number of hours the coffee shop is open for business each day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Number of Employees</td>
      <td>The number of employees working on a given day. This can influence service speed, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, sales.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Marketing Spend Per Day ($)</td>
      <td>The amount of money spent on marketing campaigns or promotions on any given day.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Location Foot Traffic (people/hour)</td>
      <td>The number of people passing by the coffee shop per hour, a variable indicative of the shop's location and its potential to attract customers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Daily Revenue ($)</td>
      <td>The total revenue generated by the coffee shop each day. It is calculated as a combination of customer visits, average spending, and other operational factors like marketing spend and staff availability.</td>
    </tr>

  <h2>Experiment 1: Evaluation</h2>
<p>
    To evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model, I used several metrics to assess its effectiveness:

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Accuracy Score</strong><br>
            Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It is a common evaluation metric for classification problems; however, it can be less reliable in the case of imbalanced datasets, such as ours. Since the dataset involves varying levels of accident severity, accuracy might not give a complete picture of how well the model is performing across all severity classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Classification Report</strong><br>
            The classification report provides key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precision:</strong> measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It indicates how many of the predicted severe accidents are actually severe.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall:</strong> measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of a specific class. It tells us how well the model detects severe accidents (or any other class).</li>
                <li><strong>F1-score:</strong> combines the mean of precision and recall into one number. It is useful when we need to balance the importance of both false positives and false negatives.</li>
            </ul>
            These metrics are particularly useful for imbalanced classes, such as accident severity, where certain classes may be underrepresented, and traditional accuracy may not fully capture the model's effectiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Confusion Matrix</strong><br>
            The confusion matrix visualizes the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives of the modelâ€™s predictions. By examining the matrix, we can understand how well the model is performing across different severity levels. It helps identify which classes are being misclassified more often and provides insight into whether the model struggles with certain severity levels.
