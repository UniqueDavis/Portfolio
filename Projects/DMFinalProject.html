  <title>Music Project – Audio Features & Song Popularity</title>

  <h1>Final Project: Audio Features & Song Popularity</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  What made a song popular in the 80s? There are many different complex factors, such as artistic values like rhythm, danceability, liveness, and many more, along with consumer behavior trends. Now that streaming platforms like Spotify collect comprehensive data on song characteristics and trends, we can track audio features like tempo, danceability, and energy levels to see if a song will become a hit. Our goal is to analyze these features and make a predictive model to see if a song made in the 80s will become a hit or not. This analysis could be useful to artists, producers, and labels that are interested in seeing what features have a high association with the probability of making a hit song.

  <h2>About the Data</h2>
  <p>
  We'll use this dataset: 
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theoverman/the-spotify-hit-predictor-dataset" target="_blank">
    The Spotify Hit Predictor Dataset (1960-2019)</a>
  </p>
  <p>The dataset contains 6908 rows, each representing a track, with 19 features. The dataset consists of different tracks from the 60s to 2019. We have decided to look specifically into the 80s for our project. Each song has a target value of 0-1, 0 indicating the song is a flop and 1 indicating the song is a hit. Additionally, each song has several audio features, such as:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>track</td><td>Name of the track.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>artist</td><td>Name of the artist.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>uri</td><td>Spotify resource ID for the track.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>danceability</td><td>How suitable the track is for dancing (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>energy</td><td>Intensity and activity level of the track (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>key</td><td>Musical key of the track (e.g., 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>loudness</td><td>Average loudness in decibels (dB).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>mode</td><td>1 = major, 0 = minor.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>speechiness</td><td>Presence of spoken words (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>acousticness</td><td>Likelihood of being an acoustic track (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>instrumentalness</td><td>Likelihood the track has no vocals (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>liveness</td><td>Likelihood the track is live (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>valence</td><td>Musical positivity (0.0–1.0).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>tempo</td><td>Tempo in beats per minute (BPM).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>duration_ms</td><td>Duration of the track in milliseconds.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>time_signature</td><td>Estimated time signature (e.g., 4 = 4/4).</td></tr>
    <tr><td>chorus_hit</td><td>Estimated timestamp of chorus start.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>sections</td><td>Number of sections in the track.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>target</td><td>1 = hit, 0 = flop (based on Billboard Hot-100).</td></tr>

  <p>
    The 80s song dataset has over 2000 unique songs, along with 19 different columns that will allow us to explore trends through different modeling techniques. Before modeling, we will perform EDA to better understand the distribution and correlation of features.
  </p>
  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <p>We plan to approach the problem as a binary classification task (<strong>Hit</strong> vs. <strong>Flop</strong>) using one of two supervised learning models:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: A good baseline model for binary classification.</li>
    <li><strong>Random Forest</strong>: To capture non-linear relationships and identify important features.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In addition, we’ll perform <strong>feature importance analysis</strong> (using permutation importance or model-specific methods) to determine which features contribute most to a song’s popularity. This could be insightful for understanding musical trends and knowing which features will be most useful to include in our model.</p>
  
  <h2>Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Our evaluation will focus on measuring the performance of our classification models in predicting whether a song is a “hit” or a “flop” based on its audio features. We will use the following classification metrics to evaluate our models:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy</strong> – Measures the rate of correct predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Precision</strong> – Evaluates the proportion of correctly predicted hits among all predicted hits.</li>
    <li><strong>Recall</strong> – Assesses the ability of the model to identify hits.</li>
    <li><strong>F1 Score</strong> – Balances precision and recall into a single metric.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A <strong>confusion matrix</strong> will be used to visualize model performance across all of the prediction categories.</p>

  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
  <p>
    This project can help influence artists, producers, and labels to approach music with data-driven insights. If artists start using our model to predict what makes a song a hit, they might focus more on those traits and create more music that people want to hear or songs that are likely to become hits. Our project shows how patterns in music can be found using data science, bridging the gap between music and technology in a meaningful way. But there is a downside. If artists, producers, or labels start following the same patterns just to make hit songs, music could lose originality and start to sound the same. Artists who want to do something different might be pushed aside or have limited opportunities, as labels may care more about profit than creativity. Also, since our model is trained on data from the 1980s, it could carry biases from that time and overlook newer or more diverse styles of music.
