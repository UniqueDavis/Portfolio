  <h1>Project One: Heart Attack Risk Prediction</h1>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
  Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection, prevention, and treatment crucial. According to the CDC, approximately 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack each year. While medical 
  advancements have improved treatment, identifying key risk factors can help individuals take preventive measures and improve their overall health.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset" target="_blank">
      Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How does smoking affect key health risk factors such as cholesterol levels and heart attack risk?</li> 
    <li>What is the relationship between sedentary hours and heart attack risk?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This analysis can help provide personalized health insights by identifying trends that may reduce heart attack risk. However, there are limitations. Since the dataset is synthetic, it may not fully capture real-world patterns, making 
    predictions less reliable for actual populations. Additionally, critical factors such as race/ethnicity and other medical conditions—which can significantly influence heart attack risk—are missing. These gaps highlight the need for 
    careful interpretation when applying findings to real-world health decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite these limitations, this project aims to explore meaningful patterns in heart attack risk and contribute to a better understanding of how lifestyle and demographic factors play a role.

  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 8764 rows, each representing an individual patient record, and 26 features. These features are important variables in determining the likelihood of a heart attack. The features include:</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>
    Several key steps were followed to prepare the dataset for analysis. First, I checked for any missing or duplicate data, and found that there were none. Next, the numerical columns I decided to use for data visualizations were shown using boxplots to check for outliers, 
    but none were detected.

  <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    This plot shows the number of people at high risk and no risk of heart attack, divided by their smoking status. The visualization clearly reveals that smokers are more likely to be at high risk for a heart attack compared to non-smokers.
