  <h1>Project One: Heart Attack Risk Prediction</h1>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
  Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection, prevention, and treatment crucial. According to the CDC, approximately 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack each year. While medical 
  advancements have improved treatment, identifying key risk factors can help individuals take preventive measures and improve their overall health.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset" target="_blank">
      Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How does smoking affect key health risk factors such as cholesterol levels and heart attack risk?</li> 
    <li>What is the relationship between sedentary hours and heart attack risk?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This analysis can help provide personalized health insights by identifying trends that may reduce heart attack risk. However, there are limitations. Since the dataset is synthetic, it may not fully capture real-world patterns, making 
    predictions less reliable for actual populations. Additionally, critical factors such as race/ethnicity and other medical conditions—which can significantly influence heart attack risk—are missing. These gaps highlight the need for 
    careful interpretation when applying findings to real-world health decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite these limitations, this project aims to explore meaningful patterns in heart attack risk and contribute to a better understanding of how lifestyle and demographic factors play a role.

  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 8764 rows, each representing an individual patient record, and 26 features. These features are important variables in determining the likelihood of a heart attack. The features include:</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <h2>Embedded Code Example</h2>

  <p>
    To prepare the dataset for analysis, I first inspected the data to see if anything stood out to me. I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary that needed to be fixed or changed. I checked for missing or duplicate data 
    and found that there were none. I dropped the "Patient ID" column because it wasn’t necessary for my analysis. Next, I used boxplots to check for outliers in the numerical columns I would be using for the visualizations 
    I created, and none existed. These steps are important to ensure that the analysis isn’t distorted by missing data, duplicates, or outliers. The data seemed clean, so I moved on to creating the visualizations.

  <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    <li>The first visualization (Heart Attack Risk Based on Smoking Status) shows how smoking status (smoker/non-smoker) correlates with heart attack risk, displaying the count of smokers and non-smokers categorized by risk (high or low).</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>The second visualization (Cholesterol Levels: Smokers vs. Non-Smokers) illustrates the correlation between smoking status and cholesterol levels, showing the distribution of cholesterol levels for both smokers and non-smokers.</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>The third visualization (Correlation Between Smoking and Other Heart Attack Risk Factors) presents how smoking correlates with other heart attack risk factors, as shown in the heatmap.</li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <li>The fourth visualization (Heart Attack Risk vs. Sedentary Hours Per Day) highlights the correlation between sedentary behavior and heart attack risk, comparing hours of inactivity in low-risk vs. high-risk groups.</li>

  <h2>Storytelling</h2>
  <p>
    From these visualizations, I learned that non-smokers are at a significantly lower risk of heart attack compared to smokers. I also found that smokers have a wide range of cholesterol levels, suggesting they are likely 
    to have both high and low cholesterol values. However, the data also shows that smokers typically have slightly higher cholesterol levels. Since smoking is associated with both higher cholesterol and an increased risk of 
    heart attack, this leads me to believe that smoking may contribute to heart attacks, at least in part, through its effect on cholesterol levels. However, other factors, such as heart rate, BMI, and stress levels, also play 
    a role. Additionally, I found that individuals who are inactive for longer periods (such as 12 or more hours per day) tend to be at a higher risk for heart disease. On the other hand, those who are very active are typically
    considered low-risk. 
  </p>
  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
  <p>
    This project could have a significant impact on public health by providing insights into how smoking and inactivity contribute to heart attack risk. Understanding that smoking raises cholesterol levels and heart attack 
    risk could motivate individuals to quit smoking. However, because the data used is synthetic and does not account for many other important factors (such as diet, genetics, or medical history), it does not fully capture 
    the complexity of heart attack risk. While the findings related to smoking and sedentary behavior are clear, more comprehensive data would be needed for a better understanding.
