  <h1>Project One: Heart Attack Risk Prediction</h1>
  
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
  Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection, prevention, and treatment crucial. According to the CDC, approximately 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack each year. While medical 
  advancements have improved treatment, identifying key risk factors can help individuals take preventive measures and improve their overall health.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset" target="_blank">
      Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the key factors influencing heart attack risk in different age groups or genders?</li> 
    or 
    <li>How do lifestyle factors like exercise, alcohol consumption, and smoking influence the likelihood of a heart attack?</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This analysis can help provide personalized health insights by identifying trends that may reduce heart attack risk. However, there are limitations. Since the dataset is synthetic, it may not fully capture real-world patterns, making 
    predictions less reliable for actual populations. Additionally, critical factors such as race/ethnicity and other medical conditions—which can significantly influence heart attack risk—are missing. These gaps highlight the need for 
    careful interpretation when applying findings to real-world health decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite these limitations, this project aims to explore meaningful patterns in heart attack risk and contribute to a better understanding of how lifestyle and demographic factors play a role.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 8764 rows, each representing an individual patient record, and 26 features. These features are important variables in determining the likelihood of a heart attack. The features include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Patient ID</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Sex</li>
    <li>Cholesterol</li>
    <li>Blood Pressure</li>
    <li>Heart Rate</li>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Family History</li>
    <li>Smoking</li>
    <li>Obesity</li>
    <li>Alcohol Consumption</li>
    <li>Exercise Hours per Week</li>
    <li>Diet</li>
    <li>Previous Heart Problems</li>
    <li>Medication Use</li>
    <li>Stress Level</li>
    <li>Sedentary Hours per Day</li>
    <li>Income</li>
    <li>BMI</li>
    <li>Triglycerides</li>
    <li>Physical Activity Days per Week</li>
    <li>Sleep Hours per Day</li>
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>Continent</li>
    <li>Hemisphere</li>
    <li>Heart Attack Risk</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>
    I first checked for duplicate rows, but there were none to remove. Then, I looked for any missing values, and there were zero missing values. So, the data is pretty clean and ready to go. After that, I applied scaling and normalization to get the dataset ready for further analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    This plot shows the number of people at high risk and no risk of heart attack, divided by their smoking status. The visualization clearly reveals that smokers are more likely to be at high risk for a heart attack compared to non-smokers.

  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
  <p>
    <!-- Add your impact content here -->
    This project can have a significant impact on public health by providing insights into the factors contributing to heart attack risk. The knowledge generated could help guide future preventive measures and personalized health interventions.
