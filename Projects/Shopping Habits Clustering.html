  <h1>Project Four: Shopping Habits Clustering</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduce the problem</h2>
  <p>
  R
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset?select=shopping_trends.csv" target="_blank">
      Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can clustering reveal distinct spending patterns, separating big spenders from budget shoppers? And which customers are most responsive to discounts and promotional offers? </li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to explore meaningful patterns in road traffic accidents and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various factors influence accident severity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Introduce the data</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 12316 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 15 features. These features are important variables in determining the risk and severity of road traffic accidents. The features include:</p>

  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
<p>
    This can be beneficial to businesses because it allows them to identify what is popular among different customer groups, improving customer experience and marketing strategies. However, there are privacy concerns when handling customer demographic data. There is also a risk of overgeneralizing certain groups. What might be missing from the data are customers' interests, values, and lifestyles. This is important because it helps explain why people buy certain products, providing deeper insights into their shopping habits, which could lead to better marketing strategies.
