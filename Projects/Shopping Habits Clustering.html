  <h1>Project Four: Shopping Habits Clustering</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduce the problem</h2>
  <p>
  In today’s competitive market, understanding customer spending behavior is key for businesses looking to optimize their product offerings and marketing strategies. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, companies can tailor their approaches to target different spending habits.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset" target="_blank">
      Shop Customer Data
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can clustering reveal distinct spending patterns, separating big spenders from budget shoppers? </li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to explore meaningful patterns in road traffic accidents and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various factors influence accident severity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Introduce the data</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 2000 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 8 features. The features include:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Customer ID</td>
      <td>A unique identifier assigned to each customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gender</td>
      <td>The gender of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Age</td>
      <td>The age of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Annual Income</td>
      <td>The annual income of the customer, representing their purchasing power.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spending Score</td>
      <td>A score assigned by the shop based on the customer’s spending behavior.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Profession</td>
      <td>The profession of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Work Experience</td>
      <td>The number of years the customer has been in their profession.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Family Size</td>
      <td>The size of the customer’s family, potentially influencing their purchasing decisions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


  <h2>What is clustering and how does it work?</h2>
   <p>
  Clustering is a type of machine learning (unsupervised learning) technique that groups data points based on their similarity with each other. Clustering can help you group customers with similar purchasing behaviors, which can then be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, or customer segmentation.
     There are different types of clustering...

  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
<p>
    This can be beneficial to businesses because it allows them to identify what is popular among different customer groups, improving customer experience and marketing strategies. However, there are privacy concerns when handling customer demographic data. There is also a risk of overgeneralizing certain groups. What might be missing from the data are customers' interests, values, and lifestyles. This is important because it helps explain why people buy certain products, providing deeper insights into their shopping habits, which could lead to better marketing strategies.
