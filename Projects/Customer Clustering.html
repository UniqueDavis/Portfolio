  <h1>Project Four: Customer Shop Clustering</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduce the problem</h2>
  <p>
  In today’s competitive market, understanding customer spending behavior is key for businesses looking to optimize their product offerings and marketing strategies. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, companies can tailor their approaches to target different spending habits.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset" target="_blank">
      Shop Customer Data
    </a>, this project aims to ansIr:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can I group customers based on their attributes and behaviors? </li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to explore meaningful patterns in customer shopping behaviors.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Introduce the data</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 2000 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 8 features. The features include:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Customer ID</td>
      <td>A unique identifier assigned to each customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gender</td>
      <td>The gender of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Age</td>
      <td>The age of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Annual Income</td>
      <td>The annual income of the customer, representing their purchasing poIr.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spending Score</td>
      <td>A score assigned by the shop based on the customer’s spending behavior.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Profession</td>
      <td>The profession of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Work Experience</td>
      <td>The number of years the customer has been in their profession.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Family Size</td>
      <td>The size of the customer’s family, potentially influencing their purchasing decisions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


  <h2>What is clustering and how does it work?</h2>
   <p>
  Clustering is a type of machine learning (unsupervised learning) technique that groups data points based on their similarity with each other. Clustering can help you group customers with similar purchasing behaviors, which can then be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, or customer segmentation.
     There are different types of clustering...
  </p>
  
  <h2>Pre-processing the data</h2>
   <p>
Before performing clustering, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed. This included:
<ul>
  <li>Handling missing values (e.g., filling or dropping them).</li>
  <li>Encoding categorical variables such as Gender and Profession using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.</li>
  <li>Normalizing/Standardizing numerical features like Age and Income to ensure fair clustering.</li>
</ul>
These steps are critical to avoid bias and ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering algorithm.
</p>
  
  <h2>Data Understanding/Visualization</h2>
  <p>
I explored the distribution of key variables such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. Using visualizations like histograms and scatter plots, I identified patterns and potential outliers. 
A scatter plot of Annual Income vs Spending Score was especially helpful to visualize natural groupings before applying clustering algorithms.
</p>

  <h2>Modeling (Clustering)</h2>
<p>
I applied K-Means Clustering to the dataset. The number of clusters (k) was determined using the Elbow and Silhouette Method, which helps identify the point where adding more clusters no longer significantly reduces the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). 
After determining the optimal k, which I chose 6. I fitted the K-Means algorithm and assigned each customer to a cluster.
</p>

  
  <h2>Storytelling (Clustering Analysis)</h2>
<p>
Each cluster was analyzed to understand its characteristics. For example:
<ul>
  <li>Cluster 1: High income, low spending – potential for upselling.</li>
  <li>Cluster 2: Low income, high spending – price-sensitive but engaged shoppers.</li>
  <li>Cluster 3: Balanced income and spending – average shoppers.</li>
  <li>Cluster 4: High income, low spending – potential for upselling.</li>
  <li>Cluster 5: Low income, high spending – price-sensitive but engaged shoppers.</li>
  <li>Cluster 6: Balanced income and spending – average shoppers.</li>
</ul>
These insights help businesses tailor their marketing strategies to specific customer groups.
</p>


  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
<p>
    This can be beneficial to businesses because it allows them to identify what is popular among different customer groups, improving customer experience and marketing strategies. HoIver, there are privacy concerns when handling customer demographic data. There is also a risk of overgeneralizing certain groups. What might be missing from the data are customers' interests, values, and lifestyles. This is important because it helps explain why people buy certain products, providing deeper insights into their shopping habits, which could lead to better marketing strategies.
