  <h1>Project Four: Customer Shop Clustering</h1>
  
  <h2>Introduce the problem</h2>
  <p>
  In today’s competitive market, understanding customer spending behavior is key for businesses looking to optimize their product offerings and marketing strategies. By segmenting customers into distinct groups, companies can tailor their approaches to target different spending habits.
  <p>
    Using the 
    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset" target="_blank">
      Shop Customer Data
    </a>, this project aims to ansIr:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can I group customers based on their attributes and behaviors? </li> 
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns in customer shopping behaviors that can actually be used to make smarter decisions.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Introduce the data</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 2000 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 8 features. The features include:</p>

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th>Explanation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Customer ID</td>
      <td>A unique identifier assigned to each customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gender</td>
      <td>The gender of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Age</td>
      <td>The age of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Annual Income</td>
      <td>The annual income of the customer, representing their purchasing poIr.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spending Score</td>
      <td>A score assigned by the shop based on the customer’s spending behavior.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Profession</td>
      <td>The profession of the customer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Work Experience</td>
      <td>The number of years the customer has been in their profession.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Family Size</td>
      <td>The size of the customer’s family, potentially influencing their purchasing decisions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <h2>What is clustering and how does it work?</h2>
   <p>
  Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning that groups data points based on similarity. It helps us find natural groupings in data without predefined labels.
    For this project, clustering allows us to discover customer segments with similar shopping behaviors. It’s useful for things like personalized marketing or promotions. 
    There are several types of clustering like Hierarchical Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering, but I used K-Means Clustering, which is one of the most popular ones.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>K-Means Clustering</strong> is an algorithm that divides data into <em>k</em> groups, where each group is represented by its center (the average of the points in the group). The algorithm works by repeatedly assigning each data point to the closest group center and then updating the center based on the points in the group. This process continues until the centers no longer change or a set number of iterations is reached.
</p>
  
  <h2>Pre-processing the data</h2>
   <p>
Before performing clustering, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed. This included:
<ul>
  <li>Handling missing values by either filling or dropping them..</li>
  <li>Encoding the categorical variables, Gender and Profession by using One-Hot Encoding.</li>
  <li>Standardizing numerical features like Age and Income to make sure everything’s on the same scale..</li>
</ul>
 These steps help ensure each feature contributes fairly to the clustering algorithm.
</p>
  
  <h2>Data Understanding/Visualization</h2>
  <p>
I explored the distribution of key variables such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. Using visualizations like histograms and scatter plots, I identified patterns and potential outliers. 
A scatter plot of Annual Income vs Spending Score was especially helpful to visualize natural groupings before applying clustering algorithms.

  <h2>Modeling (Clustering)</h2>
<p>
I used K-Means Clustering. To find the best number of clusters (k), I used the Elbow and Silhouette methods. I used on 6 clusters. Then, I fit the model and assigned each customer to one of these clusters.

  <h2>Storytelling (Clustering Analysis)</h2>
<p>
Here’s a quick breakdown of what each cluster looked like:
<ul>
  <li>Cluster 1: Older individuals with decent income who spend moderately.</li>
  <li>Cluster 2: Middle-aged high earners who tend to spend a lot.</li>
  <li>Cluster 3: Middle-aged people with low income and very low spending.</li>
  <li>Cluster 4: Wealthy but conservative middle-aged spenders.</li>
  <li>Cluster 5: Older, moderate earners who spend very little</li>
  <li>Cluster 6: Younger, low-income group with the lowest spending.</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Impact Section</h2>
<p>
    This project can help businesses figure out what’s working for each customer group and improve marketing strategies. But handling personal demographic data raises privacy concerns, and there’s a risk of overgeneralizing. There is also factors like customer interests, values, and lifestyles missing from the data that gives a deeper explain of why people buy certain things.
