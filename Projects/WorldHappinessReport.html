      World Happiness Report (2024) Dataset
    </a>, this project aims to answer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What factors most significantly influence the severity of traffic accidents, and how can they be used to predict accident outcomes?</li> 
    <!--<li>How does driving experience influence accident severity?</li> -->
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to explore meaningful patterns in road traffic accidents and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various factors influence accident severity.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Information</h2>
  <p>The dataset contains 12316 rows, each representing instances of an accident, and 15 features. These features are important variables in determining the risk and severity of road traffic accidents. The features include:</p>

  <h2>Experiment 1: Evaluation</h2>
<p>
    To evaluate the performance of the Random Forest model, I used several metrics to assess its effectiveness:

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Accuracy Score</strong><br>
            Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It is a common evaluation metric for classification problems; however, it can be less reliable in the case of imbalanced datasets, such as ours. Since the dataset involves varying levels of accident severity, accuracy might not give a complete picture of how well the model is performing across all severity classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Classification Report</strong><br>
            The classification report provides key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precision:</strong> measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It indicates how many of the predicted severe accidents are actually severe.</li>
                <li><strong>Recall:</strong> measures the model's ability to identify all relevant instances of a specific class. It tells us how well the model detects severe accidents (or any other class).</li>
                <li><strong>F1-score:</strong> combines the mean of precision and recall into one number. It is useful when we need to balance the importance of both false positives and false negatives.</li>
            </ul>
            These metrics are particularly useful for imbalanced classes, such as accident severity, where certain classes may be underrepresented, and traditional accuracy may not fully capture the model's effectiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Confusion Matrix</strong><br>
            The confusion matrix visualizes the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives of the modelâ€™s predictions. By examining the matrix, we can understand how well the model is performing across different severity levels. It helps identify which classes are being misclassified more often and provides insight into whether the model struggles with certain severity levels.
